This project explores the design, modeling, and simulation of a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV)
system to enhance energy efficiency and ensure seamless integration of solar power into the
electrical grid. The system employs a Perturb and Observe (P&O) Maximum Power Point
Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to optimize power extraction from the PV array under varying
sunlight conditions. A DC-DC boost converter regulates and steps up the voltage from the solar
panels, while a three-phase inverter converts the DC power into AC for grid compatibility.
Synchronization with the grid is achieved using a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), ensuring stable and
high-quality power delivery.


Simulations conducted in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the system's ability to maintain stable
voltage and current outputs, minimize power losses, and meet the grid standards. The study
addresses key challenges such as voltage fluctuations, grid synchronization, and reactive power
management. The results highlight the potential of grid-connected PV systems to provide a
reliable and sustainable alternative to conventional power sources, contributing to cleaner energy
and improved grid stability. This work underscores the importance of advanced control strategies
in maximizing the efficiency and integration of renewable energy systems.
